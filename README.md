# Carved Rock Fitness

## Quick Start

Run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, then start the app and mock API.

## Starter Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Enhancements:

- Added a mock API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Configured `npm start` to run the app and mock API at the same time using [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all).
- Added db.json to root as json-server's mock database
